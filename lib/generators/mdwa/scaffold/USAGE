Description:
    This generator is similar to Rails scaffold.
    It adds some tools to minimize the customization process.
    For example, HTML code is within id elements to ease the CSS part.
    All list have pagination with will_paginate gem.
    Referenced models also have their relations configured in models and views.

Example:
	It behaves equally to Rails scaffold if relations are not mentioned.
	The relations syntax:

    - rails generate mdwa:scaffold Product name:string initial_date:date category_id:category:name:belongs
    	# model product.rb
    	class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    		attr_accessible :name, :initial_date, :category_id
    		belongs_to :category
    		...

    - rails generate mdwa:scaffold Category name:string products:product:name:has_many
    	# model product.rb
    	class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    		attr_accessible :name
    		has_many :products
    		...

    - rails generate mdwa:scaffold Product name:string category:category:name:nested_many
    	# model product.rb
    	class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    		attr_accessible :name, :categories_attributes
    		has_many :categories
    		accepts_nested_attributes_for :categories, :allow_destroy => true
    		...

    - rails generate mdwa:scaffold Company name:string address:address:name:nested_one
        class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
            attr_accessible :name, :address_attributes
            belongs_to :address
            accepts_nested_attributes_for :address, :allow_destroy => true
            ...

    - rails generate mdwa:scaffold User name:string projects:projects:name:has_and_belongs_to_many
      rails generate mdwa:scaffold Project name:string users:user:name:has_and_belongs_to_many
        Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
            has_and_belongs_to_many :projects
        Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
            has_and_belongs_to_many :users

    - rails generate mdwa:scaffold Product name:string product_price:productPrice:name:has_one
    	# model product.rb
    	class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    		attr_accessible :name
    		has_one :product_price
    		...


Restrictions:
	1. The database must be configured correctly as usual.
	So, run rake db:create before start.
	
	2. For associations, you can use the mdd:association generator. 
	It generates several kinds of model relations.
	Scaffold associations will fail for model associations with specific model names, for example:
		rails g mdwa:scaffold a/groups name:string --model=group
		rails g mdwa:scaffold a/projects name:string group:a/group:name:belongs_to
	For that reason, you should use:
		rails g mdwa:scaffold a/projects name:string group:a/group,group:name:belongs_to
