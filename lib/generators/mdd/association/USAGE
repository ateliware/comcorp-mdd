Description:
	Generate migrations and models based on ActiveRecord association types.

Example:
	rails g mdd:association Library has_many Books

	rails g mdd:association Book belongs_to Library --with-opposite
		Generates the first example as the opposite

	rails g mdd:association Company nested_one Address
		Creates address_id in migration and belongs_to :address and accepts_nested_attrs in Company model
		Creates has_one :company in Address model if opposite requested

	rails g mdd:association Sale nested_many SaleItem
		Creates sale_id and belongs_to in SaleItem
		Creates has_many and accepts_nested_attrs in Sale

	rails g mdd:association User has_and_belongs_to_many Project
		Creates the join table projects_users
		Creates has_and_belongs_to_many association in both models
		The generated code indicates the join_table parameter, because often users have many to many associations and may be inheritance involved.
