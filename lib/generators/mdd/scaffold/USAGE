Description:
    This generator is similar to Rails scaffold.
    It adds some tools to minimize the customization process.
    For example, HTML code is within id elements to ease the CSS part.
    All list have pagination with will_paginate gem.
    Referenced models also have their relations configured in models and views.

Example:
    rails generate mdd:scaffold Model name:string initial_date:date category_id:category:name:belongs
